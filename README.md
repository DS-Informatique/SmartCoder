# SmartCoder

Is a massive project which includes :
- A partial accounting program.
- A code editor with visual representation of your classes in mind map.
    Offers a great range of possibilities including :
    - Context visualisation
    - Copy of Properties
    - Inheritance concepts viewed and applied
    - Syntax presentation of various tools in Vb.NET | C# | Java and Python
    - Can quantify and evaluate the price of your class and each components
    - Very good tools to learn coding by learning the syntax and punctuations all based on https://docs.microsoft.com 
Also included:
- Archivis | Chronos
  2 programs needed to make backup with the possibility of adding multiple of task and ensuiring the transfer.
  Research here has been on the focus of speed transfer as well as secure transfer.

 2 programs focuses on time and saving timesheets for pre-invoicing purposes.

 All of these programs could help one to create a mini ERP.
 
Althouth not all methoddes are functioning properly the project is still operational. It has evolved now to a new technology : ASP.NET CORE MVC version 9 which will be available on https://dsi.swiss very soon.
